# Pranav Sharma

I build practical machine learning systems for decision support under uncertainty—forecasting, pricing analytics, and risk-aware decisioning.

All projects shown here are independent portfolio work built on public or synthetic data. No confidential employer data, code, methods, or client information is included.
