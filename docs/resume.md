I design production-oriented ML systems that convert uncertainty into clear, testable decisions—across demand forecasting, pricing analytics, and risk-aware decision support.

**Selected outcomes:** ~100 person-hours/month forecasting effort reduction potential during scaled rollout, ~40 hours/month pricing analysis automation, quantile + conformal uncertainty validation, and Kubernetes-aligned deployment support.

## Profile

Senior AI Engineer focused on operationalizing machine learning in enterprise settings—from baselines and model development to reproducible evaluation, deployable artifacts, and decision-grade integration. Hands-on experience with rolling backtesting/benchmarking, probabilistic forecasting (quantiles), conformal evaluation, and production deployment support in Kubernetes environments. Strong record of mentoring junior engineers and students while translating ML work into structured, teachable workflows.
