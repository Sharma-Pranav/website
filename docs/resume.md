## Profile

Senior AI Engineer focused on operationalizing machine learning in enterprise settings — from baselines and model development to reproducible evaluation, deployable artifacts, and decision-grade system integration. Hands-on experience with rolling backtesting/benchmarking, probabilistic forecasting (quantiles) and calibration validation, plus deployment support in Kubernetes environments. Strong record in mentoring juniors/students and translating ML work into structured, teachable workflows.

## Professional Experience

### Senior AI Engineer — ebm-papst (Heilbronn)  

**03/2024 – Present**

**Demand Forecasting (Baselines → ML → Probabilistic) | 2025**

- Built end-to-end demand forecasting for replenishment/safety stock using baselines + ML + probabilistic outputs.
- Projected to reduce manual forecasting by ~100 person-hours/month globally as rollout scales.
- Standardized evaluation (MAE + |Bias|) and rolling backtesting across methods and horizons; baseline control layer.
- Implemented quantile forecasts and validated calibration, including conformal evaluation (coverage vs width trade-off).
- Benchmarked foundation-model approaches vs classical + ML baselines; tuned training and hyperparameters.

**B2B Pricing Recommendation & Optimization | 2024**

- Deployed ML pricing recommendations for negotiation start prices; standardized pricing decisions for sales teams.
- Automated pricing workflow, reducing manual analysis by ~40 hours/month.
- Built demand/response models + optimizer under guardrails; validated via offline backtesting.
- Enabled interpretable drivers and what-if sensitivity; supported Kubernetes deployment + Hugging Face artifacts.

### Research Associate — Hahn-Schickard (Villingen-Schwenningen)  

**08/2018 – 02/2025**

- Achieved 91% accuracy in hyperspectral skin lesion classification using transfer learning; contributed to securing follow-on research funding of €1.5M+.
- Led development of a deep learning multi-class classifier for hyperspectral data in collaboration with research partners.
- Designed a reinforcement learning agent to improve Kubernetes cluster throughput and operational efficiency.
- Implemented AI techniques (K-means, federated learning, explainable AI) for hyperspectral imaging and silicon wafer analysis.
- Managed resources to enable a cost-neutral 6-month project extension despite price increases; supervised/mentored 3 Master’s students.
