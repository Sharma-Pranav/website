Three “Lite” sandboxes that demonstrate decision-grade systems (not toy notebooks): **Forecast → Price → Decide**.

## Forecasting Sandbox (Lite)

**Purpose:** Benchmark forecasting methods for SKU portfolios and select a defensible per-SKU model under demand-structure differences.  
**Output:** Best model per SKU + evidence tables (MAE, Bias, Score = MAE + |Bias|) + regime tags (ADI/CV²) + audit ledger.

## Pricing Decision Lite

**Purpose:** Choose a deployable price under elasticity uncertainty (not just a point-estimate “optimal” price).  
**Output:** OPTIMIZE / HOLD / NO-GO decision + robust price recommendation + profit distribution evidence.

## Decision Kernel Lite

**Purpose:** Make decisions under uncertainty using explicit assumptions (actions × scenarios × probabilities × losses).  
**Output:** Recommended action + evidence tables for Expected Loss, Minimax Regret, and CVaR (tail risk).
